Project Overview
This project focused on building a secure and connected healthcare system by creating virtual environments for multiple hospitals. The main goal was to install and configure OpenEMR—a free and customizable electronic health record system along with tools to support real-time data sharing using the HAPI-FHIR server. The setup helps hospitals store patient records, share data safely, and support better decision-making in public health.

Objective
The objective was to design and deploy a flexible and secure digital health system across several virtual machines. Each system included tools for handling patient information, enabling communication between hospitals, and supporting better care delivery through electronic records and FHIR-based interoperability.

Technologies Used
•	Ubuntu Virtual Machines – Created individual hospital environments with unique IPs.
•	OpenEMR – Installed to manage digital patient records effectively.
•	HAPI-FHIR Server – Used to standardize and share healthcare data across systems.
•	Postman – Helped test, send, and troubleshoot FHIR resource requests.
•	UFW Firewall & Apache Security – Used to secure the servers from unauthorized access.

Challenges Faced
•	Ensuring all VMs could connect and communicate securely.
•	Setting up consistent security rules and server hardening.
•	Learning and applying new technologies like FHIR APIs and server configuration.
•	Managing installation errors and file paths across different environments.

Outcomes Achieved
•	Successfully created a network of virtual hospitals with secure OpenEMR systems.
•	Enabled safe data sharing between hospitals using HAPI-FHIR.
•	Improved understanding of server security, interoperability, and healthcare data formats.
•	Demonstrated how health IT can support real-time monitoring and improved patient care.
